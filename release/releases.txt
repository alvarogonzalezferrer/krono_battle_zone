Since is quite hard to compile this on 2020, I decided to include a pre-compiled binary file + data (sprites, gfx, etc)

You can drop this release into a DOS machine, or DOSBOX emulator, and it will run, and you will play.

To compile yourself, you need the DJGPP GCC + Allegro 4 toolchain + MS-DOS or DOSBOX

Thanks
